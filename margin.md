# Margin Trading — Margin & Short Selling Detail

## Background — Different from US Margin

**Margin trading and short selling exist in China but operate very differently from US markets.**

### Key differences from US margin
| | US Margin | China A-Share Margin |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| Eligible stocks | Most stocks | **Whitelist only** (~2000 stocks) |
| Short selling | Easy, locate-based | **Restricted** — must borrow from broker's pool, often unavailable |
| Margin ratio | ~50% (Reg T) | Brokers set, typically 50-60% |
| Hot money usage | Common at retail | **Heavily used by speculators** as a leverage indicator |

### What `rzye` and `rqye` mean
- **`rzye` (融资余额, "margin buy balance")**: Total outstanding loans for buying stock. **Rising `rzye` = bullish leverage building up.** This is the most-watched metric.
- **`rqye` (融券余额, "short sell balance")**: Total outstanding short sales. Usually much smaller than `rzye` because shorting is hard.

### Why this matters for A-share investors
- **Sentiment proxy**: Aggregate `rzye` is one of the cleanest sentiment indicators. Spikes often coincide with market tops.
- **Stock-level signal**: A stock with rapidly rising `rzye` is being aggressively bought by leveraged speculators — momentum is hot but reversal risk is also high.
- **Forced selling risk**: When stocks decline, margin holders may face forced liquidation, accelerating the drop.

### Key fields explained (all in CNY)
- **`rzye` (融资余额)**: Margin buy balance (long leverage outstanding).
- **`rqye` (融券余额)**: Short sell balance.
- **`rzmre` (融资买入额)**: Margin buy volume today.
- **`rqyl` (融券余量)**: Short sell volume in shares.
- **`rzche` (融资偿还额)**: Margin loan repayment today.
- **`rqchl` / `rqmcl`**: Short cover / short sell trading volume.
- **`rzrqye` (融资融券余额)**: Combined balance = rzye + rqye in CNY.

### Caveats
- Only stocks on the official "margin trading targets" list can be margin-traded. Check if a stock is eligible before assuming margin data exists.
- Short selling supply is often limited; `rqye` may be artificially low due to lack of borrow.
- Margin balance is **end-of-day**, not intraday.
